# It's Those Darn Avocado Toasts

In this project, data about the cost of avocados in different US regions are analyzed and compared to see the trend of avocado prices. Based on this, we are able to decide where is the best place to live in order to continue eating avocado toast for breakfast, and how long we can afford this lifestyle under different wage restraints. 

This data is from user Timofei Kornev on Kraggle (2020), who added onto the original dataset created by Justin Kiggins(2018). 

This project is a collaboration between [Emily Lieu](mailto:eclieu@ucdavis.edu) and [Tim Pham](mailto:timpham@ucdavis.edu) for the class BIS15L.
